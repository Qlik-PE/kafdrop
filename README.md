# Why This Fork Exists

This project was forked from https://github.com/obsidiandynamics/kafdrop
to address specific requirements that we had in our environment.
The primary requirements were:

* Provide a proper login screen and associated credentials.
* Support access via a secure reverse proxy

Given the scope of some of the required changes, I have elected not
to submit pull requests to the original project for all of the changes
as it is unlikely that they all would have been accepted.

## Qlik Modifiications to the Original Kafdrop

[README-QLIK-PE](README-QLIK-PE.md) describes the modifications made to the original Kafdrop 
developed by Obsidian Dynamics in this fork.

## Original Kafdrop README

[README-KAFDROP-ORIG](README-KAFDROP-ORIG.md) is the original README published with Kafkdrop. 
Despite the fact that there are some differences between this Qlik PE fork and the original, 
there is a lot of useful information about Kafdrop that can be found in this README.
